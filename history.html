                    About the Koshinkan Aikido Society
                </p>
                <p class="vertical-separation-medium">
                    The <strong>Koshinkan Aikido Society</strong> (<strong>Ko</strong> - ancient, <strong>shin</strong> -
                    heart / spirit, <strong>kan</strong> - hall ) was formed on the 6th August 1993,
                    and since then it has developed slowly but steadily. Our attitude towards
                    Aikido is an open one; we encourage our members to practice with all forms
                    of Aikido whenever possible and welcome all who will practice with an open mind.
                </p>
                <p class="vertical-separation-medium">
                    The Koshinkan Aikido Society is a non-profit making organisation, all
                    money is paid to the society and the yudansha (dan grades) receive no
                    money for teaching. The organisation and running of the society is
                    the responsibility of the yudansha, but every member has a say. The
                    primary aim of the society is to promote and develop the martial art
                    of Aikido as an amateur activity.
                </p>
                <p class="vertical-separation-medium">
                    The Aikido practiced at the Koshinkan is somewhat eclectic in style
                    reflecting the previous experience of the sensei. Our basic techniques
                    show a definite <strong>Yoshinkan</strong> influence. This is a highly structured system
                    ideal for beginners with much emphasis on posture (kamae) strong, centred
                    body movement and forceful direct atemi. The Yoshinkan with its
                    comparitively linear approach is said to reflect O'Sensei's pre WW2 teaching.
                </p>
                <p class="vertical-separation-medium">
                    Alongside the basics we also teach a wide range of techniques reminiscent
                    of the <strong>Aikikai</strong> style, with a greater emphasis on circularity and fluidity
                    of movement, including a wide range of kokyu nage which provide excellent
                    training in timing, blending of force, tai sabaki and the use of breath
                    power (kokyu). In addition to this there are further elements of training
                    which derive from <strong>Aiki-jujitsu</strong> the precursor of modern Aikido.
                </p>
                <p class="vertical-separation-medium">
                    The Koshinkan is affiliated to the <strong>UK Shinwakai</strong>, a BAB member organisation
                    with an ethos much like our own. The Shinwakai has member clubs from both
                    the Yoshinkan and Aikikai Traditional schools and is headed by Sensei Jack
                    Poole, one of the U.K's most senior Aikidoka who holds senior dan grade
                    ranking in both styles.

                <p class="vertical-separation-large">
                    The Koshinkan aikido Society originated as an offshoot of the
                    <strong>Epsom and Ewell Judo and Aikido Society</strong>
                    and to understand the history of the Koshinkan it is necessary to
                    relate the history of this club from which both
                    <a href="/sensei.html">
                        Sensei John Jenkin

                <p class="vertical-separation-medium">
                    The <strong>Epsom and Ewell Judo and Aikido Society</strong> was founded in the
                    late 1950's by <strong>Ron Thatcher</strong> sensei, it was based in Ewell
                    Surrey at a place called the Watermill. In 1966 the club moved
                    to a new location at the Sutton Rugby Club, Rugby Lane, Cheam, Surrey.
                    It was also at this time that Thatcher sensei handed the control of the
                    club to his senior student <strong>Donal G.Weir</strong>, then a Shodan and also
                    holding dan grades in ju-jitsu and karate, his studies had begun whilst
                    he had been in the Royal Marines. Many well-known aikidoka began under
                    Weir sensei, including <strong>Ken Broome</strong> sensei, now 5th.dan Tomiki Aikido,
                    and <strong>Fred Haynes</strong> sensei, 6th.dan I.Y.A.F. (Canada).
                </p>
                <p class="vertical-separation-medium">
                    <strong>John Jenkin</strong> began his Aikido training under Donal Weir sensei
                    in July 1973, he had been practising judo since 1964 but was drawn
                    to Aikido since seeing the art practised when he was ten years old.
                    The training was rigorous as Don Weir, a former marine, still kept a
                    military edge to his teaching.
                </p>
                <p class="vertical-separation-medium">
                    In 1983 Weir sensei relocated to the West Country and the club was
                    left in the hands of his senior student <strong>Ronald Walters</strong> sensei
                    then 3rd.dan, who had also studied under <strong>Kenshiro</strong> Abbe sensei,
                    <strong>Senta Yamada</strong> sensei and <strong>Jim Elkin</strong> sensei. Having his dan
                    grades in Tomiki Aikido as well as the Yoshinkan style taught by Weir
                    sensei. Ron Walters moved the focus of the club to include regular
                    Tomiki Aikido and the name of the club was renamed Koshinkan (Ko -
                    ancient, Shin - heart, Kan - hall) to emphasise the new outlook of the
                    dojo. It was at this time that Tony Hughes started his Aikido training.
                </p>
                <p class="vertical-separation-medium">
                    In September 1984 Ron Walters also moved to Devon leaving responsibility
                    for the club with John Jenkin, at that time 2nd dan and senior student.
                    By this time the Epsom & Ewell club had spawned a number of Dan grades,
                    some of whom had established their own dojo's, forming a loose association
                    with Don Weir as their notional headmaster.
                </p>
                <p class="vertical-separation-medium">
                    John Jenkin was then assigned the task of overseeing these associated clubs
                    from the point of view of ensuring consistent quality of practice and grading.
                    As a result of this and other commitments, at the end of 1988, Jenkin sensei
                    released the running of the Epsom and Ewell club to <strong>Sensei Stewart Rolland</strong>.
