                        Sensei John Jenkin conducted an orderly class and I could
                        immediately see that his students had a lot of respect for
                        him. As a first time visitor, everyone treated me in a very
                        friendly way, including Sensei. It was heart warming. I could
                        have done with a longer warm up before practice as I had not
                        practiced in winter for 35 years. The Dojo was heated but my
                        body needed to be red hot to melt the ice I felt inside! I am
                        not acclimatized to the English winter after decades of living
                        in the tropics.
                    </p>
                    <p class="vertical-separation-medium">
                        To return to the warm up, be warned: If Sue Cooper is conducting
                        the warm up, the abdominal and pectoral crunching will seem endless!
                    </p>
                    <p class="vertical-separation-medium">
                        Sensei demonstrated and explained techniques thoroughly. Sensei
                        said, and repeated with each technique demonstrated, that the
                        execution must be applied gently - that it was not necessary to
                        use force. What was funny was that Sensei's Ukes, especially Gary,
                        obviously did not think it was applied gently, as it was so effective!
                    </p>
                    <p class="vertical-separation-medium">
                        The class was concluded with 'jiyu waza', again in an orderly
                        manner with the chain rotation of partners. I wish 'jiyu waza'
                        could be conducted in this way at my dojo, because fellow aikidokas
                        would then be forced to practice with me! [You see, Malaysians are
                        generally Gary's size, and they don't want to do free practice with
                        a bigger guy like me]. In your Dojo, I found myself experiencing
                        what others in my Dojo feel like - when they practice with a bigger
                        partner. In your Dojo, I experienced practicing with bigger guys
                        than myself, especially when it came to Rob Wrate! I enjoyed my
                        'jiyu waza' with Rob.

                        So thanks to Sensei John Jenkin, and all the students there on
                        that cold Monday [14th of December 09], especially Gary who took
                        such wonderful care of me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="vertical-separation-medium">
                        My next visit to England will be in the second week of September.
                        I hope I will be able to visit your Dojo again, in warmer weather!
